## Notes

- Requires YouTube's own dark mode to be enabled (the grey overrides only apply to `html[dark]`)
- No permissions beyond `*://www.youtube.com/*` — the extension cannot read data from any other site
- No background service worker, no storage, no network requests

## Huge Credits — Sidesy by abinjohn123

**This extension would not exist without [Sidesy](https://github.com/abinjohn123/sidesy) by [@abinjohn123](https://github.com/abinjohn123).**

Sidesy is the original extension that pioneered moving YouTube comments to a sidebar. After many failed attempts at reliable SPA navigation detection, studying Sidesy's source code was the breakthrough.

### Key insights from Sidesy's code

```js
// The check that actually works — credit: Sidesy by abinjohn123
function areCommentsReady() {
  const comments = document.getElementById('comments');
  return comments &&
         !comments.hasAttribute('hidden') &&
         comments.innerHTML.length > 100; // ensures content is actually loaded
}

// yt-navigate-finish is YouTube's own reliable SPA navigation event
document.addEventListener('yt-navigate-finish', onNavigate);
```

- Use `getElementById('comments')` not `querySelector('ytd-comments#comments')`
- `innerHTML.length > 100` ensures comments are actually loaded, not just present in DOM
- `cleanup()` should only disconnect observers — never touch the DOM during navigation
- `yt-navigate-finish` is sufficient — no background scripts or extra permissions needed
- YouTube updates `#comments` in-place, so you never need to move it back on navigation
